    "\n",
    "The OTTO RecSys dataset serves as the behavioral foundation for this MVP.\n",

    "### **2.1 Data Structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each record represents an entire user session:\n",
    "\n",

    "{\n",
    "  \"session\": <session_id>,\n",

    "\n",
    "* **session** — anonymized session identifier\n",
    "* **aid** — anonymized product identifier\n",
    "* **ts** — timestamp in milliseconds\n",
    "* **type** — one of `\"clicks\"`, `\"carts\"`, `\"orders\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "Events are generally chronological, but explicit sorting is advised for correctness.\n",

    "### **2.2 Dataset Scale and Characteristics**\n",
    "\n",
    "Training split:\n",

    "\n",
    "## **2.3 Pros of the Dataset (Strengths for Our MVP)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Rich behavioral signal**\n",
    "\n",
    "The large volume of interactions enables strong signals for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* popularity estimation\n",
    "* co-visitation patterns\n",
    "* embedding-based similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Session-oriented structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sessions are self-contained and ordered, making the data naturally suited for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* next-item prediction\n",
    "* short-term intent modeling\n",
    "* context-aware recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Event hierarchy**\n",
    "\n",
    "The click → cart → order funnel provides graded implicit feedback, helpful for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* weighted frequency models\n",
    "* importance scoring in co-visitation\n",
    "* fine-grained recency weighting\n",
    "\n",
    "### **High item diversity (~1.8M items)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This encourages hybrid methods that combine:\n",
    "\n",
    "* global popularity\n",
    "* co-occurrence statistics\n",
    "* semantic embedding vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Temporal separation**\n",
    "\n",
    "OTTO provides a 4-week train + 1-week test split, which supports:\n",
    "\n",
    "* chronological validation\n",
    "* drift analysis\n",
    "* real-world generalization checks\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2.4 Potential Issues (Points to Watch Closely)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **No persistent user identifiers**\n",
    "\n",
    "Only session-level data is available.\n",
    "This limits:\n",
    "\n",
    "* long-term personalization\n",
    "* cross-session modeling\n",
    "* user-level collaborative filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "### **No product metadata**\n",
    "\n",
    "No categories, descriptions, pricing, or attributes.\n",
    "All modeling must be driven by:\n",
    "\n",
    "* behavior\n",
    "* sequence patterns\n",
    "* item IDs only\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Extreme item sparsity**\n",
    "\n",
    "Many items appear only a handful of times.\n",
    "This affects:\n",
    "\n",
    "* embedding quality for long-tail items\n",
    "* coverage for nearest-neighbor searches\n",
    "* cold-start behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Implicit feedback only**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are no explicit ratings or dwell times.\n",
    "Interpretation depends on:\n",
    "\n",
    "* interaction types\n",
    "* recency\n",
    "* frequency patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Heavy click dominance (~80%)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Clicks may overwhelm more meaningful signals without proper weighting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Test labels unavailable**\n",
    "\n",
    "The test set contains sessions with missing final target events.\n",
    "Reconstruction of next-item predictions requires special handling.\n"

    "\n",
    "- The dataset exhibits **clear daily activity patterns**, with event volumes typically in the 6–10 million range.\n",
    "- Sundays (e.g., 2022-08-14 and 2022-08-21) show **noticeable spikes**, suggesting weekly seasonality and higher user engagement at week’s end.\n",
    "- The first day (2022-07-31) has significantly fewer events, likely due to partial data capture at the start of the logging window.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modeling implications:**\n",
    "  - **Recency-aware popularity:**\n",
    "    High day-to-day variation reinforces the value of recency weighting to adapt to shifting demand.\n",
    "  - **Temporal drift monitoring:**\n",
    "    Weekly cycles imply natural fluctuations that should not be mistaken for harmful drift.\n",
    "  - **Training/validation split:**\n",
    "    A chronological split is appropriate, as behavior evolves over time.\n",
    "  - **System performance expectations:**\n",
    "    Real-time systems should be tested against peak-day load patterns."

    "### Top-Seller Recommendation Model (Recency-Weighted Popularity)\n",
    "\n",
    "This model implements the **Top-Seller** requirement by identifying globally popular\n",
    "items from the training data using **event-type weights** and **exponential recency\n",
    "decay**. The solution is fully **DuckDB-backed**, allowing scalable computation\n",
    "directly over parquet data without loading the full dataset into memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Event Weighting**\n",
    "   Each interaction type contributes differently to popularity:\n",
    "   - clicks → 1.0\n",
    "   - carts  → 3.0\n",
    "   - orders → 5.0\n",
    "\n",
    "   These weights reflect increasing strength of user intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Recency-Aware Scoring**\n",
    "   For each event, a time decay factor is applied:\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   w = \\text{event\\_weight} \\times e^{-\\lambda \\cdot \\text{age\\_in\\_days}}\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "   where `λ = RECENCY_DECAY_LAMBDA`.\n",
    "   Recent events contribute more, helping the ranking adapt to trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Aggregation in DuckDB**\n",
    "   DuckDB computes:\n",
    "   - the global maximum timestamp,\n",
    "   - weighted + decayed popularity contributions per event,\n",
    "   - total popularity per `aid`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The result is a sorted popularity table:\n",
    "   ```text\n",
    "   aid → recency-weighted popularity score\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Serving Top-Seller Recommendations**\n",
    "   For inference, the recommender simply returns the top-K globally ranked items:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   TOP_SELLERS[:k]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
